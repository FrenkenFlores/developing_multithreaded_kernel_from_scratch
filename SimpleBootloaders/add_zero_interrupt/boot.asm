; Some BIOS systems use USB FFD (Floppy Flash Drive)
; (not USB HDD - Hard Disk Drive, or something else) emulation
; which gives them the ability to interpret USB flash drive as hard disk drive.
; The BIOS expect the BPB at the begining of the sector (512 bytes), it finds it
; and then proceed to modify the BPB after it is loaded into memory to reflect the drive geometry.
; The BIOS Parameter Block is the block that holds all info about the Master Boot Record sector.
; read https://wiki.osdev.org/FAT for information.
; By adding a fake BPB which consists of 36 bytes, it should overwrite it with the actual values.
; If we don't add BPB it will overwrite first 36 bytes including our bootloader code.

; The first 3 bytes of the BPB.

    ; jump over the BPB to the code.
